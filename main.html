                Rogan began a career in comedy in August 1988 in the Boston area. After relocating to Los Angeles in
                1994, he signed an exclusive developmental deal with Disney and appeared as an actor on several
                television shows including Hardball and NewsRadio.

                In 1997, he started working for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as an interviewer and color
                commentator. Rogan released his first comedy special in 2000. In 2001, he put his comedy career on hold
                after becoming the host of Fear Factor and would resume his stand-up career shortly after the show's end
                in 2006.

                "long-form media". The podcast has been cited as being more popular and viewed than many traditional
                media sources
